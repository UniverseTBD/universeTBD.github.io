##Introduction of universeTBD

Every great story starts with a "what if?". For UniverseTBD, "What if we bridge Astronomy and Large Language Models to build something truly unique that helps researchers and enthusiasts think deeper about the great beyond?". Our very own "one small step for LLM, a giant leap for Astronomy." 

We are a group of astronomers, machine learning enthusiasts, engineers, and enthusiasts, eminently human, coming from all over the world to make it happen. Our goal is to use foundation models to democratize Astronomy for everyone and expand our horizons on what's possible for the field moving forward. One of the big questions we want to answer is: can large language models come up with unique scientific insights and hypotheses? Stay fine-tuned.
