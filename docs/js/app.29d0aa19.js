Recent advances in natural language processing have produced LLMs capable of comprehending scientific texts, summarizing findings, and even formulating novel hypotheses. This research explores the potential of modern LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex to enhance astronomers' workflows through automating tedious tasks. We investigate applying LLMs for literature reviews, surfacing insights from data, recognizing patterns in images, and generating hypotheses. Early experiments suggest LLMs can extract key information from papers, analyze data to reveal new findings, and propose directions to explore. However, challenges remain in effectively prompting the models and validating their outputs. Our research aims to develop best practices for integrating LLMs into astronomers’ toolkits to increase productivity and spur new discoveries. Rather than replacing human astronomers, LLMs can remove drudgery from tasks like reading papers and data analysis. This allows astronomers to focus their skills on higher-level recognition and ideation to advance the frontiers of knowledge. With refined techniques for prompting and evaluating LLMs, these AI systems show promise as collaborators in the astronomical research process.
