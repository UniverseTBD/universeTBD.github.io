##Mission statement ideas:

UniverseTBD: AI for Astronomy, Expanding Access and Discovery for All.

Democratizing Astronomy for all.

##General Description:

At UniverseTBD, we envision a future where the boundless realm of Astronomy is accessible to all – researchers, enthusiasts, and curious minds alike. In pursuit of this vision, we have assembled a diverse, global team of astronomers, machine learning enthusiasts, engineers, and many other passionate individuals dedicated to the democratization of Astronomy.

We are building a world where the discoveries and insights held within vast astronomical data and scientific literature are no longer confined to the few but are shared and expanded upon by the many. Harnessing the power of cutting-edge generative AI, we strive to create open-source science tools capable of producing and guiding new scientific knowledge.

We want to build AI that has the potential to assist researchers with scientific discovery by uncovering hidden patterns in the wealth of published Astronomy papers and proposing unlikely avenues of inquiry. And in doing so, we are on the brink of something revolutionary: a knowledge feedback loop that elevates our collective understanding of the cosmos.

Our work to democratize AI-assisted solutions in research in Astronomy requires a profound understanding of AI's potential benefits and risks and diligent consideration of its impacts. And in this journey, we are constantly learning, drawing from a diverse range of fields and topics to inspire fresh ideas and expand the possibilities.

At UniverseTBD, we are fueled by the power of "what if?" – a question that embodies the spirit of scientific exploration and innovation. What if we can bridge Astronomy and Large Language Models to build something unique, contributing not just a small step for AI but a giant leap for Astronomy?

Stay tuned with UniverseTBD as we take on this exciting endeavour and embark on our very own space odyssey.
