I am passionate about leveraging statistical methods to unravel the mysteries of our universe. The emergence of large language models holds promise for catalyzing a paradigm shift in astronomical research. I feel privileged to investigate the vast potential of LLMs in astronomy alongside the esteemed team at UniverseTBD. Ensuring the safe and ethical development of large language models is of great interest to me, as is using them to foster openness and transparency in academia. I really look forward to this journey of discovery."

I am also interested in all sorts of astrostatistical problems, and the synergy of machine learning techniques with everything from inference problems to better literature searches and knowledge discovery. In my non-work hours you'll often find me holed up in a bookstore, tinkering with things, or planning homebrew TTRPG campaigns."
